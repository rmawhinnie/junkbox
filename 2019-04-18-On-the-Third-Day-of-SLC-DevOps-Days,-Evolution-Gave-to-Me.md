On the Third Day of SLC DevOps Days, Evolution Gave to Me: The CAMS MODEL delivered in workshops

# Culture

Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset. At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams; engineers may do both. With DevOps, the two teams work together to optimize both the productivity of developers and the reliability of operations. They strive to communicate frequently, increase efficiency, and improve the quality of services they provide to customers. They take full ownership for their services, often beyond where their stated roles or titles have traditionally been scoped by thinking about the end customer's needs and how they can contribute to solving those needs. Quality assurance and security teams may also become tightly integrated with these teams. Organizations using a DevOps model, regardless of their organizational structure, have teams that view the entire development and infrastructure lifecycle as part of their responsibilities.

    <td>Tear Down This Wall! - Creating Real Human Connections and Winning With Technology
The corporate world has a long tradition of creating adversarial team pairs. Examples are product engineering and manufacturing; software development and IT operations; data engineering and marketing analytics. These are teams that should have a common goal, but treat each other with hostility due to mistrust and perverse incentives. In this talk, we'll discuss two strategies for tearing down walls to allow harmonious work toward objectives and get closer to BizOps. The first strategy is to create common incentives and mutual accountability. (This has been thoroughly studied in the context of DevOps.) The second strategy is crucial but often overlooked: leaders must invest in the power of human connection. Today, we are overly processed, overly engineered and dehumanized. To really connect with others, we much learn to take off our masks, and authentically share who we are. Authentic conversations develop emotional connections between people that spur real change, resulting in a strong culture of people galvanizing around a common goal.</td>

# Automation

Perhaps the most visible aspect of DevOps. Many people focus on the productivity gains (output per worker per hour) as the main reason to adopt DevOps. But automation is used not just to save time, but also prevent defects, create consistency, and enable self-service.

  <tr>
    <td>Testing in DevOps era - A change in Mindset and Skillset
'Moving Fast, Trying Not to Break Things' - is the mantra in DevOps. Making sure everything else is working for a delta change, i.e. automated regression tests have proven to be effective to secure confidence in delivering Quality Features. However, it is very expensive in terms of skillset and continuous maintenance of flaky tests. While we addressed some of the challenges by shifting the testing focus to the LEFT and also, to the RIGHT, DevOps is a culture shift; it is not only process or tools or technologies. The paradigm shifted from bug detection to bug prevention; quality is no longer only the tester’s job, rather it is everyone’s responsibility to building cross-functional T-shaped team over well-defined specialized skilled contributors.
If your organization is taking up Digital Transformation initiatives now out of necessity, this talk is for you. Do you belong to a big financial or insurance corporation with thousands of employees, over years old legacy systems, outdated tools and technologies, and employees with over decades of business and functional expertise and limited QE or SDET skillset. You may be facing the problem of balancing balancing between people vs process, institutional knowledge vs technology and how you can embrace the power of 3 Amigos. One of the themes is to practice engineering mindset and adopt developers’ technology to increase team velocity by contributing as T-Shaped Value Stream agile team. While there are several areas in which Quality Engineering practice is improving on, I will focus on how successful organizations are approaching Digital Transformation with API first mindset. This would be a work in progress solution to achieve continuous API testing using the concept of BDD and Karate DSL.
Join me while I share my experiences on how to communicate the change, motivate a team to accept the change, resourceful to implement the change and celebrate the change to ensure Speed, Reliability, Quantity, and Maintenance of test automation much needed for Continuous Delivery.</td>

# Measurement

How can you have continuous improvement without the ability to measure improvement? How do you know if an automation task is worthwhile? Basing decisions on data, rather than instinct, leads to an objective, blameless path of improvement. Data should be transparent, accessible to all, meaningful, and able to be visualized in an ad hoc manner.

    <td>Navigating Your DevOps Journey
This workshop is geared towards senior technical leaders (executives, directors or key influencers/change agents).
Senior leaders embarking on DevOps initiatives often struggle to determine where to start, what to do, and how to approach their DevOps journey. The advantages of DevOps are well-documented, but it is estimated that over the next 5 years, 75% of DevOps initiatives will fail to fully meet the expectations of the business and stakeholders. In this presentation/workshop, we will talk about the practical steps and actions specifically around culture, practices, and technology that a leader can take to maximize the probability of a successful DevOps transformation. We will talk about viewing DevOps holistically through the six core disciplines along with an approach to the DevOps toolchain. Attendees will be given a succinct, but practical guide, "Navigating Your DevOps Journey."</td>

# Sharing

Key the success of DevOps at any organization is sharing the tools, discoveries, and lessons. By finding people with similar needs across the organization, new opportunities to collaborate can be discovered, duplicate work can be eliminated, and a powerful sense of engagement can be created among the staff. Outside the organization, sharing tools and code with people in the community helps get new features implemented in open source software quickly. Conference participation leaves staff feeling energized and informed about new ways to innovate.

  <tr>
    <td>Collaboration Frameworks for DevOps
The success of DevOps depends on its technical aspects as much as on non-
technical ones, yet most organizations pay little to no attention to the latter.
One very effective (and fun) way to do some of those value-added activities
is with Collaboration Frameworks. This workshop will cover three of them.
Lighthouse: to visualize the state of quality and risk of a DevOps
environment or a project. Tug of War to visualize the level of alignment
between all the DevOps, SecDevOps or DevTestOps as well as how they
benefit or afflict each other. The 4th
Dimension to prioritize activities.</td>
