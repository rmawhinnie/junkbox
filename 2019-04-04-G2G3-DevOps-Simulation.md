G2G3 DevOps Simulation

Salt Lake City DevOps Days are excited to host G2G3, as they present their award-winning DevOps Simulation. 

The G2G3 DevOps simulation is a highly immersive learning workshop which demonstrates the business value and positive impact of a DevOps approach. The simulation focuses on the people aspects of change. Research has shown that 'overcoming cultural habits' is the biggest challenge for DevOps practitioners, followed by ‘lack of experience or understanding of DevOps practices ’*. The simulation lasts half a day and consists of three group simulation scenarios. By building an understanding of DevOps and demonstrating the impact it can have, the simulation turns participants into advocates for change.
