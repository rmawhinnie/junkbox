**On the Second Day of SLC DevOps Days, Evolution Gave to Me: **

**Guidance on a New Style of PMO**

Having worked in a PMO at the beginning of my career, and then as a Scrum Master and Program Manager, being a PMO member has been an evolving role. So what happens now, in the context of a DevOps world? Do you go away? If teams self manage, where am I?

All great questions, ones I have heard asked with hushed voices and worried tones. Lacking answers people get territorial and siloed, protecting their jobs and livelihoods. Creating an anti pattern of protectionism. So what do we need as technologists from this group going forward? We need A LOT! But a different A Lot. 

To answer these questions we are bringing in two groups who have pioneered where we PMO flow evolve to...Fresh from the DevOps Enterprise Summit Main Stage:
