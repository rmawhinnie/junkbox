**On the fifth Day of SLC DevOps Days, Evolution Gave to Me: The ability to look at the bigger picture**

Devops was never just about the Code.  It feels silly to say that, doesn't it? But many of us, myself included, started looking at DevOps as a way out from the toil of over the wall coding practices.  We thought that the next iteration of tools would invalidate our current developer V.S. OPS grudge match. Magically the sun would shine and rainbows would explode from mythical creatures nether regions.

But It didn't happen.  It turns out the magical framework is just as existent as our rainbow wielding unicorn.  There is no magic CI/CD framework that will magically solve your companies interdepartmental communication issues.  So now what? Do we give up? Go back to digging our trenches and make sure we put in a sprinkler system to douse the flaming bits of code as they are launched (It better be an automated sprinkler system that keeps metrics this is DevOps after all)

It is the process of decision making that drives a business. The way we make choices together about not only how our code will get onto the place we call the internet or who will maintain the error budget.  But what code should be written at all?  Should we be maintaining that steaming pile that we affectionately call Legacy?

I will never tire of learning new technology.  The decisions we make about our technology stack are important but pale in comparison to how we make decisions as a company.  

As we learn to have true candor and communication our speed as a business will continue to increase.  We will be able to make better decisions about not only what technology stack we use and how we deploy code but what code gets written at all.  Our bad decisions will be reversed faster and our good decisions will be validated.

Please join us this year as we evolve beyond just the tools (Don't worry there will be tool workshops galore). We will start to have real conversations about how we evolve Dev, Ops, Product into something we love being a part of.
